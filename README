NAME
       kpcli - A command line interface to KeePass database files.

DESCRIPTION
       A command line interface (interactive shell) to work with KeePass
       database files (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass).  This program
       was inspired by my use of "kedpm -c" combined with my need to migrate
       to KeePass. The curious can read about the Ked Password Manager at
       http://kedpm.sourceforge.net/.

USAGE
       Please run the program and type "help" to learn how to use it.  Run the
       program with --help as a command line option to learn about its command
       line options.

PREREQUISITES
       This program requires these non-core modules:

       "Crypt::Rijndael" - libcrypt-rijndael-perl on Ubuntu 10.04

       "Term::ReadKey"   - libterm-readkey-perl on Ubuntu 10.04

       "Sort::Naturally" - libsort-naturally-perl on Ubuntu 10.04

       "File::KeePass"   - libfile-keepass-perl on Ubuntu 12.04

       "Term::ShellUI"   - libterm-shellui-perl on Ubuntu 12.10

       It is recommended that you install "Term::ReadLine::Gnu" which will
       provide more fluid signal handling on Unix-like systems, making kpcli
       robust to suspend, resume, and interrupt - SIGSTP, SIGCONT and SIGINT.
       That module is in the libterm-readline-gnu-perl package on Ubuntu.

       You can optionally install "Term::ReadLine::Perl5", which is often
       preferred on platforms without GNU readline (MacOS, Windows, etc.)

       You can optionally install "Clipboard" and "Tiny::Capture" to use the
       clipboard features; http://search.cpan.org/~king/Clipboard/ and
       libcapture-tiny-perl on Ubuntu 10.04.

       You can optionally install "Sub::Install" to use the --timeout feature.

       You can optionally install "Data::Password" to use the pwck feature
       (Password Quality Check); libdata-password-perl on Ubuntu 10.04.

       You can optionally install "Data::Password::passwdqc", which is
       preferred by the pwck feature if it is available. That module is not
       commonly packaged and its list of dependencies is quite long, but
       cpanminus installs it nicely on Linux Mint. It appeared that all of its
       upstream dependencies were packaged in Linux Mint and so I apt-get
       install'ed them first, and then cpanminus only installed
       "Data::Password::passwdqc". Because it is a binding to a C library,
       "Data::Password::passwdqc" is much faster than "Data::Password" and
       also seems to have a bit more stict password rules.

       You can optionally install "Crypt::PWSafe3" in order to import Password
       Safe v3 files (https://pwsafe.org/). The dependency list of this module
       is hefty and it is not packaged in many distros, but cpanminus installs
       it nicely on Linux Mint (https://cpanmin.us/).

       You can optionally install "Math::Random::ISAAC" in order to use a more
       secure rand() function. Package libmath-random-isaac-perl on Debian.

       On MS Windows, you can optionally install "Win32::Console::ANSI" to get
       ANSI colors in Windows cmd terminals. Strawberry Perl 5.16.2 was used
       for the kpcli port to Windows and, using cpanminus, one can install all
       of kpcli's dependencies, sans Term::ReadLine::Gnu which is optional for
       kpcli and not supported on MS Windows.

CAVEATS AND WORDS OF CAUTION
       The main author of kpcli primarily interoperability tests with KeePassX
       (http://www.keepassx.org/) and primarily uses KeePass v1 (*.kdb) files.
       Support for KeePass v2 (*.kdbx) files in kpcli is substantial, and many
       people use it daily, but it is not the author's primary use case. It is
       also the author's intent to maintain compatibility with v1 files, and
       so anyone sending patches, for consideration for inclusion in future
       kpcli versions, is asked to validate them with both v1 and v2 files.

   Some versions of Term::ReadLine::Perl5 are incompatible
       "Term::ReadLine::Perl5" versions 1.39-1.42 are incompatible with the
       "Term::ShellUI" module, which is core to kpcli. There is information
       about this in kpcli SF bug #18
       (http://sourceforge.net/p/kpcli/bugs/18/). The "Term::ReadLine::Perl5"
       author submitted a "Term::ShellUI" patch to resolve the issue
       (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=105375) and he also
       released "Term::ReadLine::Perl5" version 1.43 which resolves it.

   No history tracking for KeePass 2 (*.kdbx) files
       Recording entries' history in KeePass 2 files is not implemented.
       History that exists in a file is not destroyed, but results of entry
       changes made in kpcli are not recorded into their history. Prior-to-
       change copies are stored into the "Recycle Bin." Note that
       File::KeePass does not encrypt passwords of history entries in RAM,
       like it does for current entries.  This is a small security risk that
       can, in theory, allow privileged users to steal your passwords from
       RAM, from entry history.

   File::KeePass bug prior to version 2.03
       Prior to version 2.03, File::KeePass had a bug related to some
       "unknown" data that KeePassX stores in group records. For File::KeePass
       < v2.03, kpcli deletes those unknown data when saving. Research in the
       libkpass (http://libkpass.sourceforge.net/) source code revealed that
       what early versions of File::KeePass classifies as "unknown" are the
       times for created/modified/accessed/expires as well as "flags" (id=9),
       but only for groups; File::KeePass handled those fields just fine for
       entries.  I found no ill-effect from dropping those fields when saving
       and so that is what kpcli does to work around the File::KeePass bug, if
       kpcli is using File::KeePass < v2.03.

BUGS
   Using Ctrl-D to Exit
       Versions of Term::ShellUI prior to v0.9. do not have the ability to
       trap Ctrl-D exits by the client program. I submitted a patch to remedy
       that and it made it into Term::ShellUI v0.9. Please upgrade if kpcli
       asks you to.

   Multiple Entries or Groups With the Same Name in the Same Group
       This program does not support multiple entries in the same group having
       the exact same name, nor does it support multiple groups at the same
       level having the same name, and it likely never will. KeepassX does
       support those.  This program detects and alert when an opened database
       file has those issues, but it does not refuse to save (overwrite) a
       file that is opened like that. Saves are actually safe (no data loss)
       as long as the user has not touched one of the duplicately-named items.

                            back into place after realizing that v0.03 of
                           File::KeePass did not resolve all of the problems.
        2011-Apr-23 v1.0 - Changed a perl 5.10+ regex to a backward-compatable
                            one to resolve SourceForge bug number 3192413.
                           Modified the way that the /Backup group is ignored
                            by the find command to stop kpcli from croaking on
                            multiple entries with the same name in that group.
                            - Note: There is a more general bug here that
                                    needs addressing (see BUGS section).
                           An empty title on new entry aborts the new entry.
                           Changed kdb files are now detected/warned about.
                           Tested against Term::ShellUI v0.9, which has my EOF
                            hook patch, and updated kpcli comments about it.
                           Term::ShellUI's complete_history() method was
                            removed between v0.86 and v0.9 and so I removed
                            kpli's call to it (Ctrl-r works for history).
                           Added the "icons" command.
        2011-Sep-07 v1.1 - Empty DBs are now initialized to KeePassX style.

                           Fixed a kdb_has_changed bug in the saveas command.
                           Fixed a cli_open bug where it wasn't cli_close'ing.
                           Fixed variable init bugs in put_master_passwd().
                           Fixed a false warning in warn_if_file_changed().
        2011-Sep-30 v1.2 - Added the "export" command.
                           Added the "import" command.
                           Command "rmdir" asks then deletes non-empty groups.
                           Command "new" can auto-generate random passwords.
        2012-Mar-03 v1.3 - Fixed bug in cl command as reported in SourceForge
                            bug number 3496544.

                           Added my_help_call() to allow for longer and more
                            descriptive command summaries (for help command).
                           Stopped allowing empty passwords for export.
        2012-Oct-13 v1.5 - Fixed "help <foo>" commands, that I broke in v1.4.
                           Command "edit" can auto-generate random passwords.
                           Added the "cls" and "clear" commands from a patch
                            with SourceForge ID# 3573930.
                           Tested compatibility with File::KeePass v2.03 and
                            made minor changes that are possible with >=2.01.
                           With File::KeePass v2.03, kpcli should now support
                            KeePass v2 files (*.kdbx).
        2012-Nov-25 v1.6 - Hide passwords (red on red) in the show command

                           Added support for multi-line notes/comments;
                            input ends on a line holding a single ".".
        2013-Apr-25 v1.7 - Patched to use native File::KeePass support for key
                            files, if the File::KeePass version is new enough.
                           Added the "version" and "ver" commands.
                           Updated documentation as Ubuntu 12.10 now packages
                            all of kpcli's dependencies.
                           Added --histfile command line option.
                           Record modified times on edited records, from a
                            patch with SourceForge ID# 3611713.
                           Added the -a option to the show command.
        2013-Jun-09 v2.0 - Removed the unused Clone module after a report that
                            Clone is no longer in core Perl as of v5.18.0.
                           Added the stats and pwck commands.

                           Fixed some long-standing tab completion bugs.
                           Warn if multiple groups or entries are titled the
                            same within a group, except for /Backup entries.
        2013-Jun-10 v2.1 - Fixed several more tab completion bugs, and they
                            were serious enough to warrant a quick release.
        2013-Jun-16 v2.2 - Trap and handle SIGINT (^C presses).
                           Trap and handle SIGTSTP (^Z presses).
                           Trap and handle SIGCONT (continues after ^Z).
                           Stopped printing found dictionary words in pwck.
        2013-Jul-01 v2.3 - More readline() and signal handling improvements.
                           Title conflict checks in cli_new()/edit()/mv().

                           cli_new() now accepts optional path&|title param.
                           cli_ls() can now list multiple paths.
                           cli_edit() now shows the "old" values for users
                            to edit, if Term::ReadLine::Gnu is available.
                           cli_edit() now aborts all changes on ^C.
                           cli_saveas() now asks before overwriting a file.
        2013-Nov-26 v2.4 - Fixed several "perl -cw" warnings reported on
                            2013-07-09 as SourceForge bug #9.
