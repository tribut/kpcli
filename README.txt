NAME
    kpcli - A command line interface to KeePass database files.

DESCRIPTION
    A command line interface (interactive shell) to work with KeePass
    database files (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass). It supports all
    version 1.x (*.kdb) and 2.x (*.kdbx) prior to the KDBX4 update.

    This program was inspired by my use of "kedpm -c" combined with my need
    to migrate to KeePass. The curious can read about the Ked Password
    Manager at http://kedpm.sourceforge.net/.

USAGE
    Please run the program and type "help" to learn how to use it.  Run the
    program with --help as a command line option to learn about its command
    line options.

INSTALLATION
    Please see https://sf.net/p/kpcli/wiki/Installation%20instructions

CAVEATS AND WORDS OF CAUTION
    The main author of kpcli primarily interoperability tests with KeePassX
    (http://www.keepassx.org/) and primarily uses KeePass v1 (*.kdb) files.
    Support for KeePass v2 (*.kdbx) files in kpcli is substantial, and many
    people use it daily, but it is not the author's primary use case. It is
    also the author's intent to maintain compatibility with v1 files, and
    so anyone sending patches, for consideration for inclusion in future
    kpcli versions, is asked to validate them with both v1 and v2 files.

Version 4 of the KDBX file format is unsupported
    KeePass 2.35 introduced version 4 of the KDBX file format (KDBXv4) and
    it is unsupported by File::KeePass. File::KeePass can only decrypt
    databases encrypted with the AES cipher and newer KeePass versions
    offer ChaCha20, which will also save the file as KDBXv4. File::KeePass
    also does not support the new Argon2 key derivation function (KDF).

      - https://keepass.info/help/kb/kdbx_4.html
      - https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::AuthEnc::ChaCha20Poly1305

    As of KeePass 2.46, you can use the "File -> Database Settings ->
    Security" tab to set the encryption algorithm to AES/Rijndael and the
    key derivation function to AES-KDF and then kpcli will be able to
    operate on the files.

    As of KeePassXC 2.7, you can use the "Database -> Database Security ->
    Encryption Settings" tab to change the "Database format" to "KDBX 3"
    kpcli will be able to operate on the files.

Filesystem Access and Tab Completion on Microsoft Windows
    Filesytem access and tab completion on Microsoft Windows uses forward
    slashes, and so paths like: c:/Users/hightowe/personal.kdb

    File tab completion is also case insensitive, which seems cumbersome,
    but it matches Windows filesystem behavior.

Some versions of Term::ReadLine::Perl5 are incompatible
    "Term::ReadLine::Perl5" versions 1.39-1.42 are incompatible with the
    "Term::ShellUI" module, which is core to kpcli. There is information
    about this in kpcli SF bug #18
    (http://sourceforge.net/p/kpcli/bugs/18/). The "Term::ReadLine::Perl5"
    author submitted a "Term::ShellUI" patch to resolve the issue
    (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=105375) and he also
    released "Term::ReadLine::Perl5" version 1.43 which resolves it.

No history tracking for KeePass 2 (*.kdbx) files
    Recording entries' history in KeePass 2 files is not implemented.
    History that exists in a file is not destroyed, but results of entry
    changes made in kpcli are not recorded into their history. Prior-to-
    change copies are stored into the "Recycle Bin." Note that
    File::KeePass does not encrypt passwords of history entries in RAM,
    like it does for current entries.  This is a small security risk that
    can, in theory, allow privileged users to steal your passwords from
    RAM, from entry history.

File::KeePass bug prior to version 2.03
    Prior to version 2.03, File::KeePass had a bug related to some
    "unknown" data that KeePassX stores in group records. For File::KeePass
    < v2.03, kpcli deletes those unknown data when saving. Research in the
    libkpass (http://libkpass.sourceforge.net/) source code revealed that
    what early versions of File::KeePass classifies as "unknown" are the
    times for created/modified/accessed/expires as well as "flags" (id=9),
    but only for groups; File::KeePass handled those fields just fine for
    entries.  I found no ill-effect from dropping those fields when saving
    and so that is what kpcli does to work around the File::KeePass bug, if
    kpcli is using File::KeePass < v2.03.

BUGS
Using Ctrl-D to Exit
    Versions of Term::ShellUI prior to v0.9. do not have the ability to
    trap Ctrl-D exits by the client program. I submitted a patch to remedy
    that and it made it into Term::ShellUI v0.9. Please upgrade if kpcli
    asks you to.

Multiple Entries or Groups With the Same Name in the Same Group
    This program does not support multiple entries in the same group having
    the exact same name, nor does it support multiple groups at the same
    level having the same name, and it likely never will. KeepassX does
    support those.  This program detects and alert when an opened database
    file has those issues, but it does not refuse to save (overwrite) a
    file that is opened like that. Saves are actually safe (no data loss)
    as long as the user has not touched one of the duplicately-named items.

Text::Shellwords::Cursor parse_line() infinite loop
    There is a bug in Text::Shellwords::Cursor::parse_line() that will send
    it into an infinite loop. To trigger it, one need only try to do tab
    completion with an escape character as the last character on the
    command line. This perl one-liner demonstrates the problem:

      $ perl -MData::Dumper -MText::Shellwords::Cursor \
            -e '$p=Text::Shellwords::Cursor->new(); \
            @t = $p->parse_line("open c:\\u"); print Dumper(\@t); \
            @t = $p->parse_line("open c:\\"); print Dumper(\@t);'

    The second call to parse_line() will enter an infinite loop.

                         removed between v0.86 and v0.9 and so I removed
                         kpli's call to it (Ctrl-r works for history).

                         SourceForge patch #11.
                      - Mark /_found entries as "*OLD" when listed, if
                         they reside in a group named old. Addresses an
                         issue where searches turn up "old" accounts.
     2020-Apr-25 v3.4 - Marking of "*OLD" /_found entries now includes
                         those having any "old" group in the entire path.
                      - Added get_macos_version() and now report more
                         details for macOS in the vers command.

                      - Added some vers reporting of a few OS-specific
                         modules (around clipboard functionality).
                      - Added the "ver -vv" and "vers -v" options, for
                         additional verbosity of version reporting.
                      - Added --pwsplchars option, as requested in
                         SourceForge feature request #19.
                      - Fixed a few new "perl -cw" warnings.
                      - Added "use diagnostics" and cleaned up some items
                         that it pointed out.
                      - Added Google Authenticator style 2FA-TOTP support,
                         and with it the otp and xo commands.
                      - Added --xpxsecs option, as requested in
                         SourceForge feature request #20.

                         SourceForge bug #42.
                      - Fixed inability to change fields back to empty,
                         in response to SourceForge bug #43. The problem
                         still exists for Password and Notes, but a good
                         fix for those eludes me.
                      - Support for using perl modules installed in one's
                         home directory (~/perl5) on Unix-like systems.
                      - Added KeePass v2 (*.kdbx) support to export.
                      - The show command now redacts 2FA keys in Comments

                      - Fixed an issue in cli_saveas() where the *.lock
                         file from the saveas source file was stranded.
                         Also fixed not properly switching to v2 behavior
                         when saveas-ing a v1 file to v2 (*.kdb to *.kdbx).
                      - Enhanced load_lsb_release() so that it will work
                         on more Linux operating systems.

                      - Fixed a couple of bugs in the stats command.
                      - Minor, non-functional changes to prevent warnings
                         in new_edit_single_line_input() and cli_pwck().
                      - Replaced checks of $OPTIONAL_PM{<foo>}->{loaded}
                         with simpler calls to is_loaded(<foo>).
                      - Added several defined() tests that "use diagnostics"
                         pointed out on an older perl that I used (v5.10.1).
     2020-Oct-14 v3.6 - Allow multiple --command parameters and execute them
                        in order, per SourceForge feature request #22.
                      - Do a cli_ls() when find returns only one result and
                        the user asks to show it. Fixes SourceForge bug #44.
                      - Added --pwscmin and --pwscmax command line options,
                        per SourceForge feature request #23.
                      - Added --nopwstars per SF feature request #24.
                      - Added --pwwords and --pwlen command line options.
                      - Word-based generated passwords respect --pwlen.
                      - Added cli_passwd() to change the DB password.
                      - Only show help message when requested by --help, not
                        also when there are command line option errors.
                      - The cd command with no specified path now goes to /.
                      - Improved open_kdb() error reporting after seeing
                        https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1820134
                        and learning of the new kdbx v4 file format that
                        File::KeePass does not support.
                        Reference: https://keepass.info/help/kb/kdbx_4.html
                      - New message requesting kpcli development sponsorship.
                      - Removed the PREREQUISITES section from the POD and
                        replaced it with INSTALLATION that simply refers the
                        reader to the "Installation instructions" in the
                        kpcli project Wiki on SourceForge.
                      - Minor POD fixes.
     2022-May-19 v3.7 - Added my_complete_onlyfiles() and used it to work
                        around Term::ShellUI problems with file tab
                        completion on Windows, which now works properly.
                      - File tab completion is now case-insensitive on mswin.
                      - Now use my_complete_onlyfiles() for all platforms,
                        after discovering some other Term::ShellUI file
                        tab completion problems, even on Linux.
                      - cli_pwck() now supports Data::Password::zxcvbn and it
                        is the preferred pwck module, if it is installed.
                         - Info: https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn
                      - Added get_dirs() to the BEGIN block and stopped using
                        File::Find after realizing that it somewhat defeated
                        the purpose that I was trying to accomplish there.
                      - Added --nopwprint per SF bug report #44.
                      - Added the -f option to the autosave command.
                      - Fixed a --nopwstars bug per SF bug report #47.

                      - Minor POD fixes.
                      - Added kdb_savetmp-related code to cli_save() to
                        guard against problems like the one reported in
                        Debian bug report #1006917.
     2022-Jul-21 v3.8 - Added get/set commands per SF feature request #27.
                      - Added version detection for KDBX files.
                      - Added the KDBX version in the stats output.
                      - Now reports that KDBX4 files cannot be opened.
                      - Can now import KDBX4 files using KeePassXC.
                      - Added deny_if_readonly() to import command.
     22-Jul-21 v3.8.1 - Fixed get/set commands bug. See SF feature req #27.

TODO ITEMS
      Consider adding support for setting the Expires date/time on entries
      when creating or editing them.

      Consider enhancing pwck with these features:
        - https://metacpan.org/pod/WebService::HIBP
        - https://metacpan.org/pod/Password::Policy::Rule::Pwned
      Inspired by tools such as:
        - https://sts10.github.io/2019/02/01/medic.html
        - https://github.com/gsurrel/keepwn

      Consider alternative KeePass libraries due to stagnation of
      File::KeePass. CPAN module File::KDBX is available as of
      April 30, 2022! KDBX4 support will likely be coming in a
      future version of kpcli, by way of File::KDBX.

      Consider adding support for TOTP with different digest algorithms
      than just SHA-1, such as SHA-256 and SHA-512. Also consider allowing
      the TOTP time to be something other than 30 seconds and the length
      of the OTP to be something other than six digits. None of those
      options are broadly used today, but when writing the TOTP code, I
      stumbled across a few. I did not implement it now primarily because
      Authen::OATH is not very condusive to using other digest algorithms.
      For future reference, would likely construct the strings like this:
        2FA-TOTP-SHA256: TheBase32SecretKeyProvided (30, 10)
      This code may prove useful if I decide to not use Authen::OATH:
      https://github.com/j256/perl-two-factor-auth/blob/master/totp.pl

      Consider adding TOTP storage support that is compatible with the
      way that KeePassXC provides it.

      By design, kpcli displays groups and entries in the hierarchy
      and order that they are stored in the keepass files. This is
      by design as the output then follows the hierarchey seen in
      grapical programs like KeePass and KeePassXC. Users may prefer
      to have groups and entries sorted. Consider adding a sort
      command and/or a command line option that would change the
      behavior of ls to sort its output (perhaps --sortls).

      Consider adding a tags command for use with v2 files.
       - To navigate by entry tags

      Consider supporting KeePass 2.x style entry history.
       - There are potential security implications in File::KeePass.
       - Related, consider adding a purge command for that history.

      Consider adding KeePass 2.x style multi-user synchronization.

      Consider adding searches for created, modified, and accessed times
      older than a user supplied time.
